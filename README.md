# Dashboard Project

## Overview
This project is a responsive dashboard application created using React and Material-UI (MUI). The dashboard includes two main pages:
1. **Dashboard Page**: Displays data visualizations and key metrics for an eCommerce scenario.
2. **Order List Page**: A feature-rich table for managing and viewing order details.

The live version is deployed and accessible at: [https://sensational-paletas-7a5952.netlify.app/].


## Features
1. **Dashboard Layout**:
   - Divided into two main grid containers, designed with responsive layout principles.
   - Metrics include cards for "Customers," "Orders," "Revenue," and "Growth."
   - Visualizations include a bar graph for projections vs. actuals, a line graph comparing revenue across weeks, a "Revenue by Location" section with city-specific revenues, a pie chart with custom styling for total sales report, and a table for top-selling products.

3. **Order List Table**:
   - Displays orders with columns for "Order ID," "User," "Project," "Address," "Date," and "Status."
   - Table features include pagination (10 rows per page), sorting, filtering, searching and multi-row selection.
   - A modal form with validations allows users to add new data to the table, then edit and delete after select any columns".

4. **Sidebar Navigation**: Left Sidebar & Right Sidebar
  - Requires careful attention to structure, responsive layout, and state management. Additionally, ensuring scalability for future content and   user preferences adds further complexity to maintaining an intuitive and functional sidebar.

5. **Theme Management**:
   - Theme settings allow toggling between dark and light modes, enhancing user experience and accessibility.
